BioCoop' is an e-commerce website I made after graduating from the Ironhack bootcamp to strengthen my knowledge about the MERN stack and add typescript to it. This project is currently in V1 and will growth in the months to come. The client can scroll the sales promotion selection at the bottom of the home page or select the desired category in the menu. Feel free to test it, but keep in mind that you need to **SIGNUP FIRST** to add the items in the basket :

## Scraping
I used Puppeteer and Puppeteer-cluster to scrape about 5000 items and add it into a sqlite3 database first. Then I cleaned and parsed the data before adding it to the Mongo database.
